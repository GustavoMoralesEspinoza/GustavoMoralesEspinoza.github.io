## About Me

## About Me

My work bridges **distribution network engineering** and **intelligent optimization systems**, with a strong emphasis on improving **power quality** and **reliability** in smart grids. I specialize in:

**Distribution Network Analysis & Planning**  
Integration of microgrids, DERs (PV, WG, BESS), and demand forecasting into modern distribution planning frameworks, with a focus on hosting capacity evaluation.

**Evolutionary Computation & Optimization**  
Application of Evolutionary Algorithms, Metaheuristics and Swarm Intelligence for solving large-scale planning problems and Engineering Optimization

**Smart Grids & Reliability Indices**  
Improving Reliability indices and other quality indicators through advanced simulation, stochastic Monte Carlo modeling, and multi-objective optimization strategies.

I am currently pursuing my **PhD in Electrical Engineering at [USP](https://www5.usp.br)**, where I am also a member of the [RCGI – InnovaPower Hub](https://sites.usp.br/rcgi/br/programas-e-projetos-2/nucleo-de-inovacao-em-sistemas-de-energia-innovapower), the Center for Studies in Regulation and Power Quality (**ENERQ**), and the **GEPEA** – Power and Energy Group.  My doctoral research covers **distribution network planning, smart grids, microgrids, evolutionary computation, and artificial intelligence**, addressing the technical and operational challenges of future energy systems under high penetration of distributed resources.

Previously, during my MSc at [UNESP](https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/), I studied distribution planning for **Industry 4.0 consumers** using evolutionary algorithms. I hold a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from [UNSA](https://www.unsa.edu.pe/), where I specialized in **structural design and applied engineering**, building a multidisciplinary foundation that now supports my work in energy systems.
