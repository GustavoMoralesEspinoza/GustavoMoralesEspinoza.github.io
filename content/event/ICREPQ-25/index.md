summary: Hosting capacity assessment for PV/BESS in distribution networks using Monte Carlo + evolutionary optimization.
abstract: This presentation discusses a stochastic–evolutionary framework for distribution network planning under high PV/BESS penetration.
  We combine OpenDSS-based Monte Carlo simulations with multi-objective metaheuristics (GA/PSO/NSGA-II) to evaluate hosting capacity,
  voltage quality, reverse power flow, and energy losses. Results on real Brazilian feeders show how DER allocation and BESS scheduling
  improve power quality indices (e.g., SAIDI/SAIFI proxies) and mitigate overvoltage, supporting smart grid planning and microgrid integration.
