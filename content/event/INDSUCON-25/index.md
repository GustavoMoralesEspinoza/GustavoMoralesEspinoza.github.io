summary: Multi-stage adaptive GA framework for distribution expansion planning, incorporating reliability and power quality for sensitive industrial customers.
abstract: >
  This paper introduces a methodology for planning the expansion of distribution networks with an emphasis on reliability and service quality for sensitive industrial customers. 
  The proposed approach applies an Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) with elitism, adaptive mutation, and dynamic recombination to balance investment cost, electrical losses, and financial penalties due to inadequate service continuity. 
  Monte Carlo Simulation is integrated to evaluate stochastic disturbances, reliability indices (SAIDI, SAIFI, CCIFI, CCIDI), and economic losses from voltage sags and interruptions. 
  Results on a modified 18-bus test system highlight that reliability-oriented planning improves individual reliability indices, reduces overall losses, and enhances system resilience under industrial demand growth.
