summary: Stochastic Monte Carlo framework to evaluate hosting capacity of PV in distribution networks, analyzing voltage profiles, losses, and reverse power flow.
abstract: >
  This work presents a **stochastic methodology** for hosting capacity assessment of photovoltaic (PV) systems in an 18-bus distribution network. 
  Using historical irradiance and temperature data, a **Monte Carlo simulation** framework was developed to capture seasonal variability and emulate realistic PV allocation scenarios. 
  The methodology evaluates the effects of PV penetration on **voltage stability**, **power losses**, and **reverse power flow**, offering a replicable approach to assess distributed generation impacts under uncertainty. 
  Results show that moderate PV penetration improves undervoltage conditions and reduces losses, while higher integration levels increase risks of overvoltage and bidirectional flows. 
  The framework contributes to **distribution network planning** in the context of the energy transition, providing insights into safe and optimized DER integration:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
